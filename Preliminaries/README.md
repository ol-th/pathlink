## Pathway_participation

This module is for establishing a Protein's participation in a certain named pathway.

Invoke the module using something like this:

```
python3 -m Pathway_participation.query "PARP1" "Base excision repair"
```

This would query the Pathway Commons and KEGG datasets to establish whether PARP1 participates in the Base excision repair pathway.
