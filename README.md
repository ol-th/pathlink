# pathways-project

This is the repository containing my 3rd year project research.

## Structure

### Preliminaries

These are the files and programs I used for my preliminary research into the Biological Pathways domain prior to the full system design

### System

This is the cumulative result of the work so far with a frontend Flask webserver and hopefully
a REST-style API.

This frontend accepts structured queries fulfilling the criteria set out in the report.
