# Phase 1

The intention of this part of the project is to generate different "fact-checker" queries to establish participation of genes in a specified pathway.

I used KEGG and Pathway Commons for this task to achieve a good spread of the data.

The purpose of this exercise is to establish that there is enough data to perform a
full diagnosis derivation by beginning with specific examples.
